Shell and CLI Tooling configuration

* GNU Stow Packages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:97de8a8b-b016-4dc9-8b6d-d9666ce3781c
:END:

The following sections generate the contents of a collection of GNU Stow
packages. GNU Stow then places the packages onto the host file system
using symlinks. The goal is to keep the configuration isolated from the
rest of the file system and provide a simple mechanism for
(de)activating particular parts of the configuration.

** The Bourne Again Shell (Bash)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:aa649677-0762-4c6c-8d54-02b19fdbd982
:END:

Some shells are considered more modern, or fashionable, but the =bash=
shell is ubiquitous, mature, simple enough, and powerful.

A [[https://devhints.io/bash][quick reference]] should be enough for most to get started with Bash
scripting, but for a more in depth look at Bash see the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/][GNU reference
manuals]].

This section contains [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Bash-Startup-Files][startup file configuration]] for Bash. The
configuration loaded by Bash depends on the type of shell requested.

*** Interactive Shells
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:76713425-b32e-437e-8030-341b23427f93
:END:

An interactive shell is one in which a user is expected to provide input
commands sequentially - a terminal session, for example.

#+begin_quote
An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments, unless
-s is specified, without specifying the -c option, and whose input and
error output are both connected to terminals (as determined by
isatty(3)), or one started with the -i option.

An interactive shell generally reads from and writes to a user’s terminal.

The -s invocation option may be used to set the positional parameters
when an interactive shell is started.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a
non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and
executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After
reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and
~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the
first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be
used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell
executes the exit builtin command, Bash reads and executes commands from
the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.
#+end_quote

*** Non-interactive Shells
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:636baa6c-2968-41fc-b85b-41f411c46435
:END:

A non-interactive shell might be launched by another program - a shell
script with a =#!/usr/bin/env bash= SHEBANG line, for example.

*** Configuration for non-login shells
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :mkdirp yes :tangle ./bash/.bashrc
:CUSTOM_ID: h:d460ad42-3cd5-497c-a1af-465a8bbea92c
:END:

When a Bash shell is started as a non-login shell, it reads and executes
the =.bashrc= located in the user's =$HOME= directory.

#+begin_quote
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash
reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This
may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option
will force Bash to read and execute commands from file instead of
~/.bashrc.
#+end_quote

Typically one might find configuration which affects the function of
Bash here - modifications to the file system paths on which Bash looks
for programs, libraries, etc.

**** $PATH
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6239ffa0-12f5-40a4-8985-dcba74e6eb2f
:END:

This section configures the lookup =$PATH=. This is =:= separated list of
paths on the file system in which Bash will lookup commands and
libraries. This configuration changes the default lookup path of a
system in the following ways:

- items stored in the =$HOME/bin= are appended to the path. This gives the
  user a place to put scripts and libraries they with to use in their
  home directory and they'll be available for lookup in the path. This
  path is appended to avoid shadowing system binaries and libraries.
- items stored in =/usr/local/bin= and =/usr/local/sbin= are given
  precedence over those stored elsewhere on the file system. For
  example, if a program =wumpus= were present in both =/bin= and
  =/usr/local/bin=, the latter version would be invoked when =wumpus= is
  invoked.

#+begin_src sh
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src

**** Prompt
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a3276615-99d2-4259-acbe-87c88e698ef7
:END:

This section configures the shape and coloring of the Bash prompt. Below
is an example of what this prompt looks like:

#+begin_example
[maximilian: .files] organize-configuration-for-gnu-stow-management(+1) *+ →
$ ls
#+end_example

Some notable features:

- The prompt will colorize its components when the terminal supports
  colors.
- When the terminal supports colors, the =$= character will indicate the
  =exit= code status of the last run command - green for =exit 0= (success),
  and red for a non zero exit code.
- When the current working directory is a git directory
  - show the current git branch.
  - show a count of the number of commits deviation from the base and/or
    remote branch directly after the branch name.
  - show status indicators to the right of the commit deviation metrics.
    =*= indicates un-staged changes in the working directory exist. =+= indicates
    staged, but uncommitted changes exist in the index. =^=
    indicates the stash queue is not empty.

**** Initialize the asdf runtime version manager
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:422d73f5-f683-424e-b209-e2869bbe43ff
:END:

asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime version on a
per-project bases. It's like =gvm=, =nvm=, =rbenv=, =pyenv=, et al. all rolled
into one simple user interface. It is extendable via plugins and can
managed a wide variety of runtimes and tools.

This section runs the asdf system initialization, and adds bash
completions into the shell.

**** Globally disable the spring application prelaoder
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:38009432-321f-4864-a816-672fbc0fa0e6
:END:

The =spring= ruby gem is an application preloader. It aims to increase
developer productivity by reducing the amount of time spent waiting for
a Rails application to boot. However, in my experience its shortcomings
with regard to handling code reloading leads to tricky-to-debug
situations where the version of the application running in memory might
not necessarily represent the application described by the code-on-disk.

This setting attempts to avoid tricky head-scratching sessions by
disabling =spring= globally.

#+begin_src sh
DISABLE_SPRING=1
#+end_src

**** Overcommit
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:02f87061-1ddb-4400-a7f4-98c9d732bf07
:END:

The overcommit ruby gem installs and runs git pre-commit hooks which
check thing like:

1. are the application dependnecies up to date?
2. are there any database migrations which aren't present in the schema
   definition?

These hooks are run on every commit. This sounds like a wonderfully
useful tool, however in practice this make the process of creating a git
commit take at least 10 seconds while ruby loads and executes the hooks.
This is untenable and discourages frequent commits. What's more the
overcommit gem does not play well with non-cli git tools - such as the
Magit emacs package. This configuration globally disables the overcommit
gem.

*** Configuration for login shells

:END:

Login shells loads the =.bash_profile= when created; typically via a
terminal, or Secure Shell (SSH) connection.

#+begin_quote
When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a
non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and
executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After
reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and
~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the
first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be
used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell
executes the exit builtin command, Bash reads and executes commands from
the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.
#+end_quote

First, we load any configuration for the Bash's predecesor; the Bourne
Shell. Then we load the non-login shell configuration for Bash. Finally
we run any login-specific tasks before we finally start to load the Bash
login configuration. If any of the above configuration files are not
present or not readable they're skipped. This is an attempt to offer
the most backward compatibility while not sacrificing portability.

#+begin_src sh

Some UNIX-like operating systems support a global configuration option
which instructs commands to use ANSI Color control sequences in their
output. Setting the =CLICOLOR= environment variable enables this on such
systems. macOS is one such UNIX-like operating system which supports
this global colorizing configuration.

:END:

Some systems which do NOT honor this global switch for output coloring
DO tend to provide command level flags to colorize their output. These
next bits provide aliases of standard commands to their colorized
counterparts.

This configuration has the following effects:

- =ls= will make different inode types visually distinct from one another.
  Directories, files, symlinks, etc will visually distinguish themselves
  from one another.
- =grep= will highlight matches in its output.

#+begin_src sh :tangle (if (eq system-type 'gnu/linux) "./bash/.bash_profile" "no")

#+end_src

**** Aliases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:cef90d04-82ab-4cda-b086-9fe82a8173e3
:END:

Bash supports creating a custom alias to a command string. When used as
the first word of a simple command an alias expands to its command
string. There are rules concerning the definition and use of aliases,
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Aliases][please see the Bash reference manual's topic on Aliases for more
details]]. The aliases defined herein provide shorthand notation to
frequently run or often forgotten, but useful, commands.

#+begin_src sh
alias gs="git status"
alias gl='git log --graph --oneline --decorate --max-count 10'
#+end_src

On Debian GNU/Linux hosts, adds a shorthand to copy data to the system
clipboard from the terminal.

**** Bash Completion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8bf842c8-3698-427b-923a-eb6aebdac2cd
:END:

The Bash Completion extension shows a list of possible completions when
the user types a partial completion candidate followed by the <TAB> key
twice. This is helpful in narrowing down potential commands and
arguments. For example =ls<TAB><TAB>= may expand and show the following
commands as potential completions:

#+begin_example
root@3acfddd4f63d:/# ls
ls
lsattr
lsblk
lscpu
lsipc
lslocks
lslogins
lsmem
lsnsls
lsattr
lsblk
lscpu
lsipc
lslocks
lslogins
lsmem
lsns
#+end_example

On macOS hosts, Homebrew may provide the bash-completion package and
we'll load completions according to its conventions - see the Homebrew
documentation on [[https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion][Shell-Completion]] for more.

Some commands will open a text editor to complete their action - =git
commit=, for example. Bash will execute the command stored in the =EDITOR=
environment variable to launch a text editor in these cases. This makes
sure that =emacs= is the preferred text editor.

**** History
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e5fd5623-9c78-4490-9b89-a73b048b51e3
:END:

Bash has the capabilities keep track of the commands entered into
interactive shells. History is searchable and executable. The [[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-bash-history-commands-and-expansions-on-a-linux-vps][How To Use
Bash History Commands and Expansions on a Linux VPS]] guide and
[[https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/07/07/supercharge-your-bash-history.html][Supercharge Your Bash History]] articles are primary sources for the
following configuration. The configuration below achieves the following
goals:

- Each command appends itself to the history on entry. By default, bash
  writes its history at the end of each session, overwriting the
  existing file with an updated version. This means that if there are
  multiple bash sessions only the last one to exit will have its history
  saved.
- Entering a command will automatically log itself to the history.
- Store only unique commands in bash history. Don't store multiple
  instances of =ls= for example. The =HISTCONTROL= =erasedups= configuration
  value controls this.
- Prefixing a command with a white space character excludes it from the
  history. The =HISTCONTROL= =ignoreboth= configuration value controls this.
- The Bash defaults on the number of items and size of the history -
  they harken back to days when storage was more expensive. This sets a
  reasonably large cap on the number of items to keep in history via the
  =HISTSIZE= and =HISTFILESIZE= environment variables.
- Provides a blacklist of command "patterns" which should never appear
  in the history via =HISTIGNORE=. Typically having history entries for
  the following commands in the bash history either accounts for clutter
  and removes or obscures the more meaningful history entries.
  Therefore, we prevent creating history entries for the following
  commands.

#+begin_src sh
shopt -s histappend
export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -n; history -w; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups
export HISTSIZE=100000
export HISTFILESIZE=10000000
export HISTIGNORE=bg*:cd*:clear*:exit*:fg*:ll*:ls*:pwd*:history*

This file is ready during =asdf='s initialization it provides instance
wide configuration for the =asdf= program itself.

Each language's version manager communities seem to have come to
different conclusions on how to represent "required versions". The
=legacy_version_file= setting here tells =asdf= to allow the language
specific plugin to attempt to use the language's version manager
community's default file for specifying a version - for example the =asdf=
Ruby plugin will look in =.ruby_version= first for Ruby version
declarations as well as =.tool-versions=.

** Git version control system

This section configures the =git= version control system.

*** Basic configuration
:properties:
:header-args: :mkdirp yes :tangle ./git/.gitconfig
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4bf2329d-a16a-4a78-b813-b2540a2b4268
:end:

This section provides the core configuration of the =git= version control
system. the following contains configuration which:

- instructs git how to write the author information for commits.
- references a global / host gitignore file.
- prints colorized output for git commands like =status=, and =diff=.
- defines aliases, or shorthand, for frequently used, or often forgotten
  git incantations.
- signs every commit with my gnupg key to verify the authenticity of
  such commits to other parties.
- configures the =git clean= command to be less intrusive - ie drop the
  "are you sure?" charade.
- only pushe the current branch when running =git push=;rather than
  pushing all refs in the local repository.
- prevents =git= from eagerly fetching the tags from the =origin= remote.
  this is useful for improving the responsiveness of large repositories
  with lots of tags, and the user may manually download them later if
  they so choose.
- performs a =--prune= operation on each fetch from the =origin= remote.
  again, this is useful for large repositories where the =origin= may
  contain refs which i'll never need to reference. when removed
  from the remote, these branches are automatically removed from the
  local object database as well.

This configures the global list of files and patterns that git should
ignore. This typically contains items which are specific to the local
environment or workflow which should never exist in a git repository,
but would be inappropriate to include in the project's =.gitignore=.
example include, artifacts left behind by local editors, tools,
operating system file managers, etc. which may not be common across
contributors.

The following ignores:

- Artifacts left behind by the macOS finder
- Emacs autosave and backup files

:header-args: :mkdirp yes :tangle ./ruby/.rspec
:CUSTOM_ID: h:466d4e53-4de3-48e5-ade6-2846e3e49c50
:END:

This section specifies system-wide configuration for rspec - the ruby
behavior driven development tool. this ensures that:

- example and specification output should use the terminal control
  characters to colorize output. this provides rich visual feedback of
  the success, failure, or omitted status of examples in the rspec
  suite.
- rspec should use the "progress" output format. this displays a series
  of =.=, =f=, and =s= characters to indicate the output status of individual
  examples. these characters indicate a success, failure, or "skip"
  respectively.
- examples run in order according to the =--seed= of the runner. by
  default, rspec uses a random seed for each run, but the order of a
  specific run is reproducable by passing its =--seed= to the =rspec=
  command. this is helpful for surfacing dependencies between example,
  leaked / persistent state, etc between sequential runs of
  specifications.

This section generates a script used to bootstrap new system with the

The setup script resides in the =$HOME/bin= directory, which means it
should be executable on the user's =$PATH=. To start the initial host
setup process run =initial-host-setup=.

macOS has a surprising lack of "package management system". Homebrew is
the closest thing, but has functional deficiencies. Nonetheless, in most
cases it's better than nothing so we ensure that it exists on macOS
hosts here.

#+begin_src sh :tangle (if (eq system-type 'darwin) "./scripts/bin/initial-host-setup" "no")

And now we're ready to ensure that each of the packages are installed.
on macOS hosts, we use homebrew to install packages.

#+begin_src sh :tangle (if (eq system-type 'darwin) "./scripts/bin/initial-host-setup" "no")

Apple seems to hate the idea of [[https://www.fsf.org/][free software]] and has refused to update
the =bash= shell in macOS for some time - [[https://support.apple.com/en-ca/ht208050?fbclid=iwar0z1-tk9h3oinv_byv9fda9ebxxxzoqsai4osfq5_fxdi7jxvkjs3yakvk][in fact they've gone so far as
switching the user's default shell to zsh, and added an annoying
depreciation warning when using bash in macOS Catalina (10.15)]]... Here
we'll use Homebrew to install a recent version of =GNU Bash= and make sure
it's our default shell.

#+begin_src sh :tangle (if (eq system-type 'darwin) "./scripts/bin/initial-host-setup" "no")

#+end_src

Change the shell to Bash for the rest of the setup script. This also has
the affect of loading the newly generated bash configuration which makes
installing things like =asdf= a bit easier.

#+begin_src sh :tangle (if (eq system-type 'darwin) "./scripts/bin/initial-host-setup" "no")

#+end_src

Now that asdf-vm is in place, install the language specific plugins I typically use.

#+begin_src sh :tangle "./scripts/bin/initial-host-setup"
asdf_plugins='ruby nodejs'

Ensures that docker-compose is present and ready to use. On macOS this
comes bundled in the Homebrew cask version of docker, so there's nothing
for us to do. However on GNU/Linux hosts we need to do some additional
steps to get everything up and running.

#+begin_src sh :tangle (if (eq system-type 'gnu/linux) "./scripts/bin/initial-host-setup" "no")
if [ $(which docker-compose) ]
then
    echo "installing docker-compose..."
    sudo curl -l "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo curl -l https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.24.1/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
else
    echo "docker-compose already installed. skipping..."
fi

Now that the packages are installed, we /may/ want to do some inital
configuration of them - setting up custom terminal profiles for example.
This next section allows for automated, post-installation configuration
of these packages.
