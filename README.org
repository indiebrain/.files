#+TITLE: Dotfiles

* Prerequisites

  Installation requires an Emacs installation with =org-mode=,
  =org-babel=, and =org-babel-tangle= available -- all of which are
  part of the standard library of modern Emacs versions. Installation
  should Just Workâ„¢ with Emacs v24+.


* Installation

** Automated from the web with cURL

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    curl -L https://github.com/indiebrain/.files/raw/master/install.sh | sh
  #+END_SRC


** Manually

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ git clone git@github.com:indiebrain/.files.git ~/.files
     $ cd ~/.files
     $ ./install.sh
   #+END_SRC


* Credentials

  Some CLI tools require sensitive credentials. Obviously we don't
  want to store these in the repository. Sensitive credentials are
  stored in the excluded-from-version-control =credentials.org=. The
  folowing is an example of the structure of the =credentials.org=
  configuration file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+TITLE: Credentials

    Authentication credentials for CLI tools

    ,** Github
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args: :tangle ~/credentials/.github :mkdirp yes
       :END:
