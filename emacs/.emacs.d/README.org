#+DESCRIPTION: GNU Emacs, just the way I like it
#+AUTHOR: Aaron Kuehler

This repository holds my emacs configuration.

* Installation

1. Clone this repository
  #+begin_src sh
    git clone https://indiebrain@github.com/indiebrain/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d/
  #+end_src
2. Run emacs. The =emacs-init.el= is automatically generated and loaded
   from the =emacs-lisp= code blocks contained within =emacs-init.org=
   =org-babel=.

* Notes

This configuration is compatible with Emacs 27+ and uses =org-babel=
to maintain a Literate Style configuration in [[./emacs-init.org][emacs-init.org]].

Initialization is performed in [[./early-init.el][early-init.el]] and [[./init.el][init.el]].

Since version 24, Emacs has inforporated the ELPA package manager as
core functionality. The configuration makes heavy use of the =package=
and =use-package=.
