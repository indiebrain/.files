#+TITLE: .emacs.d
#+DESCRIPTION: GNU Emacs, just the way I like it
#+AUTHOR: Aaron Kuehler

This repository holds my emacs configuration.

* Installation

This configuration is maintained as a GNU Stow package as part of my
dotfiles. Please refer to [[https://github.com/indiebrain/.files#installing][the installation documentation of my dotfiles
repository]] for details.

* Notes

This configuration is compatible with Emacs 28+ and uses =org-babel=
to maintain a Literate Style configuration.

Initialization is performed in [[./early-init.el][early-init.el]] and [[./init.el][init.el]]. The bulk of
documentation and configuration is in the [[./indiebrain-emacs.org][indiebrain-emacs.org]].

Since version 24, Emacs has inforporated the ELPA package manager as
core functionality. The configuration makes heavy use of the =package=
library.
